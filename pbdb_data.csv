G. K. Warren, the Geologist of the Expedition, Dr. F. V. Hayden collected a number of remains of mammals and turtles, from a deposit, in the valley of the Niobrara River (Swift-running-water; L'eau-qui-court), which he suspects to be of pliocene age. The collection is an exceedingly in- teresting and important one; and the anatomical characters of the specimens support the opinion of their discoverer, that the formation, from which they were obtained, belongs to the later tertiary period."
